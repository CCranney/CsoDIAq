Function: library_file_to_dict()
Purpose: This function reads the file type of the input file (accepts .mgf, .csv and .tsv formats) and runs it through the
            appropriate reading function. Basically, this function is a catch-all used in the corresponding menu function to
            determine how to best read in a particular library spectra file.
Parameters:
    'inFile' - string representing the file path to the desired library spectra file.
    'numLibPeaks' - int representing the maximum number of peaks allowed per library spectrum. The [numLibPeaks] peaks with
        the highest intensity are included, everything else is excluded. Default maximum number of peaks is 31, as determined
        in the corresponding menu function.
Returns:
    dictionary 'lib'
        key - (float, string) tuple.
            float - corresponding to the precursor m/z value of the library spectrum.
            string - corresponding to the full UniMode peptide name/sequence represented by the library
                    spectrum.
        value - dictionary
            'PrecursorCharge': int indicating the charge of the library spectrum.
            'transition_group_id': string indicating library spectrum identifier.
            'ProteinName': string indicating the name of the protein this peptide corresponds to
            'Peaks': list of (float, float, tuple) tuples.
                float 1 - representing the m/z of the peak.
                float 2 - representing the intensity of the peak.
                tuple - equal to the corresponding key in the 'lib' dictionary. This is to identify the
                    library this peak belongs to, as they will be mixed with peaks from other libraries.

Function: traml_library_upload_csv()
Purpose: Given a traml file in .tsv or .csv format representing the library spectra, this function generates a dictionary to
            be used for future analysis. key:value pairings are described in the "Returns" section of this comment. Note that
            the tuple key format was chosen because library spectra will need to be sorted and chosen by precursor mass, so
            identifiers already included in the library spectra were explicitly not used as keys.
Parameters:
    'fileName' - string representing the path to the library spectra file (required traml .tsv or .csv format).
Returns:
    dictionary 'lib' - See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().

Function: lib_mz_match_query_window()
Purpose: This function determines which library spectra fit within the baseline precursor mass window of the

        to the query spectrum in question.
    'sortedLibKeys' - a list of (float, string) tuples. List represents all keys of the dictionary 'lib' from

Function: approx()
Purpose: Given two float values, this function returns a float value indicating the difference between two peaks m/z.
            Note that ppm is proportional, not static. For example, the ppm calculated for a difference between 1 and 2
            will be much higher than a ppm calculated for a difference between 1,000,000 and 1,000,001, even though
            statically the difference is identical.
Parameters:
    'x' - first float value, corresponding to the theoretical mass (library mz).
    'y' - second float value, corresponding to the experimental mass (query mz).
    'ppmTol' - ppm used to determine tolerance.
Returns:
    float - Returns the difference (in ppm) of the two values if the difference is less than the provided tolerance.
            If the difference is outside the provided tolerance, 0 is returned instead for conditional purposes.

Function: ppm_offset()
Purpose: Given a peak mz value and a ppm offset value, this function calculates the mz offset that would need to be
            subtracted from the mz value to align the final spread of ppm differences around 0.
Parameters:
    'mz' - Mz value of a given peak (generally a query peak)
    'ppm' - Ppm offset value. This is generally calculated from an uncorrected csodiaq output. During the uncorrected
        csodiaq output generation, this value is generally 0, which in turn makes the returned mz offset 0.
Returns:
    float - Mz offset value.
'''
def ppm_offset(mz, ppm):
    return (mz*ppm)/1000000


'''
Function: peak_comparison()
Purpose: This function determines peaks that are within a sufficiently close tolerance to one another. Various functions
            requiring peak comparison then take place inside this function, including compiling data for a cosine
            similarity score. The specifics of the various functions can be found in the return values below.
Parameters:
    'libSpectrum' - list of (float, float, tuple) tuples. Represents spectrum peaks - see 'Peaks' key explanation in function
        library_file_to_dict().
    'libKeys' - (float, string) tuple. See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().
    'expMz' - list of floats. Corresponds to m/z values from the experimental spectrum being analyzed. Matched by index
        with the 'expIntensity' parameter.
    'expIntensity' -list of floats. Corresponds to intensity values from the experimental spectrum being analyzed. Matched
        by index with the 'expMz' parameter.
    'ppmTol' - see 'ppmTol' parameter description for function approx().
    'ppmYOffset' - The value in ppm that should be subtracted from the query peak m/z. This is the average ppm difference
        of an uncorrected csodiaq output, being applied to the experimental spectra to generate a corrected
        csodiaq calculation output.
Returns:
    dictionary 'cosDict'
        key - (float, string) tuple. See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().
        value - list of floats
            float - sum of products of intensities between matched library and query peaks. In context of the cosine
                similarity score algorithm, this is the "A*B" sum.
            float - sum of squared query peak intensities when matched to a library peaks. In context of the cosine
                similarity score algorithm, this is the "B^2" sum.
            float - sum of squared library peak intensities when matched to a query peaks. In context of the cosine
                similarity score algorithm, this is the "A^2" sum.
    dictionary 'countDict'
        key - (float, string) tuple. See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().
        value - int
            Representing the number of matched peaks. This value will be the 'shared' column value in the output file.
    dictionary 'ionDict'
        key - (float, string) tuple. See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().
        value - set representing the indices of the query peaks that matched the library spectrum represented in this
                dictionary value. The sum of these query peak intensities will be returned as the 'ionCount' column
                value in the output file.
    dictionary 'ppmDict'
        key - (float, string) tuple. See dictionary 'lib' key explanation in function library_file_to_dict().
        value - list of floats represents the ppm difference of all peak matches that were within the given ppm tolerance. This is
                most directly used for determining the ppm offset and standard deviation of an uncorrected
                csodiaq output to be used in generating a corrected csodiaq output. For a corrected csodiaq output,
                it is primarily used for figure generation to compare with uncorrected csodiaq output.

    'outFile' - string representing the path to the output/results file.
    'ppmFile' - a string representing the path to the ppm difference results file. The first three columns

Function: find_offset_tol()
Purpose: Given a list of ppm differences from peaks that matched in a cosine similarity score analysis, this function
            determines the offset and tolerance that can be used in correcting a second analysis. Generally when seeing the
            list of ppm differences from an uncorrected analysis as a histogram you will see the main peak off-center from
            "0", suggesting all query spectra results were almost identically biased due to machine error. Uncorrected
            analyses have no offset (offset=0) and a wide tolerance to determine the "peak" in this histogram for corrective
            analysis.
        Also, if provided a string corresponding to the file path and file name of a desired histogram, the function will
            also write a histogram for visual confirmation.
        NOTE: We used the mean and second standard deviation as the offset and tolerance, respectively. However, other
            means can be used to determine all values that lie in the "peak" shown in the histogram.
Parameters:
    'data' - a list of floats. Each float corresponds to a library-query peak match in the previous analysis, depicting the
        ppm difference between the two (which was within the ppm tolerance of the analysis).
    'histFile' - string corresponding to the file path and file name of a desired histogram. If histFile == 0, no histogram
        will be written.
Returns:
    'offset' - float corresponding to the calculated ppm offset to be used in future corrected analyses.
    'tolerance' - float corresponding to the calculated ppm tolerance to be used in future corrected analyses.

Parameters:
    'inFile' - string representing file path and name to the query_spectra_analysis() function output. Data from said file is
